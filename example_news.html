<h2>We followed the Tour of CA</h2><p>We caught the last few statges of the Amgen Tour of California.<br>World champion Peter Sagan and Track starts Mark Cavendish and Sir<br>Wiggo himself were also in attendance.</p><p>The point-to-point ride will begin in Thousand Oaks, home to race title sponsor Amgen. From there, the riders will descend the famous Mulholland Highway to Pacific Coast Highway for a scenic tour of the Santa Monica Mountain range before cruising to the strawberry fields of Oxnard. The route will pass through the classic California surf town of Ventura along the coast before beginning the challenging part of the ride which features many rolling hills in the approach to the finish climb on Gibraltar Road. On the ride up to the summit, riders will experience spectacular 180-degree views of Santa Barbara and the Pacific Ocean throughout the 10 kilometers which ascent at an average grade of 8%. Participants can join Voigt in shouting his classic mantra "Shut Up Legs" during the toughest moments of the ride.</p>
