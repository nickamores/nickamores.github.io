<p>Here is where I go on about myself and my artistic influences, but, we all know that's bs. To be perfectly honest I was never much of an artist as a child, but when I got my hands on my father's Canon film SLR to use in my first photography classes, I was hooked. Although there is a wide variety of subject matter in my work, the challenge of capturing motion or a moment are what I find the most rewarding.</p>
